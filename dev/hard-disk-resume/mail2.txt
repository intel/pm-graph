On resume, the SD driver currently waits until the block driver finishes
executing a disk start command with blk_execute_rq. This patch changes
the sd_resume callback to use blk_execute_rq_nowait instead, which allows
it to return immediately, thus allowing the next device in the pm queue
to resume. The return value of blk_execute_rq_nowait is handled in the
background by sd_resume_complete. Any commands issued to the scsi disk
during the startup will be queued up and executed once the disk is online.
Thus no information is lost.

This patch applies to all three resume callbacks: resume, restore, and
runtime-resume. There is only a performance benefit for resume, but for
simplicity both restore and runtime-resume use the same code path.

The execution flow has changed from a single, synchronous call, to two
calls: one called to start sd_resume asynchronously, the other called on
completion. Thus the dmesg log will now show two prints for each drive
resume, on resume start and complete. The scsi sense data is managed
the same, but is now analyzed and freed in sd_resume_complete.

This code copies a portion of sd_start_stop_device, scsi_execute_req_flags,
and scsi_execute directly into sd_resume: effectively circumventing
sd_start_stop_device to start disks. This is to enable only the START_STOP
command to use blk_execute_rq_nowait instead of blk_execute_rq. So
sd_start_stop_device is now only used to stop the device. The disk is
started from within the sd_resume call itself. Another approach might be to
create an async version of scsi_execute to better preserve the code path
but I'm reticent to allow any other scsi commands to execute asynchronously.
