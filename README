-- Description --

This tool is designed to assist kernel and OS developers in optimizing
their linux stack's suspend/resume time. Using a kernel image built 
with a few extra options enabled and a small patch to enable ftrace, 
the tool will execute a suspend, and will capture dmesg and ftrace
data until resume is complete. This data is transformed into a set of 
timelines and a callgraph to give a quick and detailed view of which
devices and kernel processes are taking the most time in suspend/resume.

-- Kernel Configuration --

    The following kernel build options are required for all kernels:
        CONFIG_PM_DEBUG=y
        CONFIG_PM_SLEEP_DEBUG=y
        CONFIG_FTRACE=y
        CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER=y
        CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER=y

        There is a patch which does this for the ubuntu raring kernel:
        (config/analyze_suspend_kconfig_ubuntu.patch)

	In kernel 3.15.0, two patches were upstreamed which enable the
        v3.0 behavior. These patches allow the tool to read all the
        data from trace events instead of from dmesg. You can enable
        this behavior on earlier kernels with these patches:

        (config/pre-3.15/enable_trace_events_suspend_resume.patch)
        (config/pre-3.15/enable_trace_events_device_pm_callback.patch)

	If you're using a kernel older than 3.15.0, the following
        additional kernel parameters are required:
        (e.g. in file /etc/default/grub)
        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="... initcall_debug log_buf_len=16M ..."

	If you're using a kernel older than 3.11-rc2, the following simple
		patch must be applied to enable ftrace data:
        in file: kernel/power/suspend.c
        in function: int suspend_devices_and_enter(suspend_state_t state)
        remove call to "ftrace_stop();"
        remove call to "ftrace_start();"

        There is a patch which does this for kernel v3.8.0:
        (config/pre-3.11-rc2/enable_ftrace_in_suspendresume.patch)

-- Usage --

1) First configure a kernel using the instructions from the previous
   sections. Then build, install, and boot with it.
2) open up a terminal window and execute the script:
   %> sudo analyze-suspend.py -m mem
3) wait for the system to suspend (system time stops counting at system 
   suspend so you can wait as long as you need). Then press a key to resume.

When the system comes back you'll see the script finishing up and
creating the output files in the test subdir.

It generates output files in subdirectory: suspend-mmddyy-HHMMSS
    HTML output:                    <hostname>_<mode>.html
    raw dmesg output:               <hostname>_<mode>_dmesg.txt
    raw ftrace output:              <hostname>_<mode>_ftrace.txt
